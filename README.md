# Background of the Project

 Music is a universal language that transcends cultural boundaries and speaks to the depths of human emotion and experience. Music has the power to stimulate memories, stir passions and bring people together in a profound way, from the rhythmic beats of tribal drums to the intricate melody of symphony orchestras.

Music has the power to stimulate memories, stir passions and bring people together in a profound way, from the rhythmic beats of tribal drums to the intricate melody of symphony orchestras.  Classical music is one of the most enduring and beloved forms of music. Rooted in centuries of tradition and innovation, classical music encompasses a vast repertoire of compositions that have stood the test of time.

Rooted in centuries of tradition and innovation, classical music encompasses a vast repertoire of compositions that have stood the test of time. Classical music, with its rich history and diverse repertoire, has long been a source of inspiration and admiration for musicians and audiences alike. For its complexity, beauty, and emotional depth, the compositions of great classical composers such as Bach, Beethoven, Mozart, and others are revered.For musicians and audiences alike, classical music has long been a source of inspiration and admiration, with its rich history and diverse repertoire.

Eventhough the classical music is not really popular today, classical music does not remain static. It's continuing to evolve and be an inspiration for new generations of musicians and composers. The use of technology, particularly artificial intelligence (AI), is one way in which classical music has evolved. AI can change the way music is composed, performed and listened to, opening up new possibilities for creativity and expression. The growing interest in using AI in recent years has promoted the usage of AI in so many field including music generation. Generative AI, in particular, has shown promise in this regard. By analyzing vast amounts of musical data, generative AI algorithms can learn the patterns and structures that define a particular style or genre of music.  This allows them to compose new compositions which are stylistically similar to those of the composers they've been trained in. 

There are a number of possible benefits to the revival of classic music using generative AI. New instruments and techniques for the creation of music may be made available to composers, enabling them to explore new creative possibilities. By introducing classical music to new audiences in a fresh and engaging way, it can also help preserve and support classical music. The use of generative artificial intelligence for music composition also presents challenges and considerations which need to be addressed. Ensuring that the compositions created with artificial intelligence are original and creative rather than merely imitating existing works is one of the main challenges. In addition, questions are being raised about the role of a composer in AI's creative process and how to attribute and recognize music generated by artificial intelligence.

# Research Questions

The project will based on following research questions. These research questions are designed to provide a comprehensive exploration of the use of generative AI for recomposing classical music, covering technical, and artistic aspects of this emerging field.

1. How effectively can current generative AI algorithms capture the stylistic elements of classical music, such as melody, harmony, and form?
2. What kind of generative models that can produces the most pleasant music ?
3. How do AI-generated classical music compositions compare to established works in the classical repertoire, both in terms of technical execution and artistic expression, as evaluated by musicians and audiences?

# Research Objectives

The objective of this project is to investigate the use of generative AI for recomposing classical music. Specifically, the study aims to achieve the following objectives:

1. To developed a
